# PIM - Privileged Identity Management (Proof of Concept)

## Overview

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) for implementing **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** using Python. PIM helps organizations manage, monitor, and secure access to critical resources by assigning and controlling privileges within an infrastructure.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Dynamically assign and revoke privileged roles to users.
- Implement time-based or approval-based role activation.
- Log all privileged actions for audit purposes.

## Getting Started

This POC is designed for developers or system administrators who want to understand and experiment with Privileged Identity Management in a simplified environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Role Assignment:** Temporarily grant privileged roles to users as needed.
- **Approval Mechanism:** Introduces a time-based or approval-based workflow to activate privileged access.
- **Auditing and Logging:** Records actions taken by privileged users for compliance and audit purposes.

## How it Works

The system simulates a basic PIM framework with roles that can be dynamically activated and deactivated. The roles have different levels of permissions for system resources. Here's an outline of how the main features work:

1. **Role Assignment:** A user requests to elevate their role to perform privileged actions.
2. **Approval/Time-bound Access:** Depending on configuration, access is granted either immediately (time-bound) or after an approval process.
3. **Logging:** All actions performed by users with elevated roles are logged for auditing purposes.
4. **Revoking Access:** Once the access period expires, the role is automatically revoked.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pim-privileged-identity-management-poc.git
   cd pim-privileged-identity-management-poc
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. To run the PIM system, execute the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. The system will prompt you to simulate privileged identity management operations:
   - Assign roles to users.
   - Revoke roles after a certain period.
   - Log the actions performed by each user.

3. You can modify `config.py` to customize roles, permissions, and time-bound settings.

### Example:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
```text
Assign Role to User: john_doe
Role: Admin
Duration: 1 hour
```

This will grant John Doe the Admin role for 1 hour, after which his role will automatically be revoked.

### Testing

To ensure the project is working correctly, you can run the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

The tests cover:
- Role assignment and revocation
- Logging of privileged actions
- Configurations for time-bound and approval-based access

### Key Components to Implement

1. **Role Assignment System:** 
   - Create functions that allow assigning roles to users.
   - Include expiration or approval conditions.

2. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - Capture actions performed by privileged roles.
   - Log the duration, actions taken, and by whom.

3. **Time-Based Revocation:**
   - Implement functionality to revoke access automatically after a set duration.

4. **Tests:**
   - Unit tests to ensure role assignment, logging, and revocation work as expected.
